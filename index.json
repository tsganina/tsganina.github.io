This is an innovative technology that is currently developing at a rapid pace and is finding new applications in everyday life, economics, manufacturing, medicine and other fields.\nThe development of artificial intelligence began in the middle of the XIX century, but the real heyday of this technology occurred in the XXI century. Today, AI is used in a large number of industries, contributes to the development of medical diagnostics, the transport and chemical industries, and robotics. Among the most famous AI applications are Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa – virtual assistants that help improve the convenience of human and computer communication.\nHowever, the development of AI is not without its problems. Among other things, there are questions about data security and human ethics. Some scientists and public figures call for caution regarding AI, fearing its power and possible social impact.\nIt should be noted that there are several directions of AI development. These directions can be different and influence which type of AI to use for a specific task. One of the most interesting areas of development is the development of algorithms that will save resources and improve the quality of life of people around the world.\nIn order for artificial intelligence to become a real human assistant, scientists and specialists need joint interaction and discussion of this topic. On this path, it is important to consider all possible problems and risks for society. This is the only way to identify potential problems before they can be solved.\n","date":1684627200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684627200,"objectID":"a6988a0b8c5cc56a2bdabf9b41ced7e9","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82/","publishdate":"2023-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82/","section":"post","summary":"What is an AI, why it is needed and how it looks in its natural habitat.","tags":["Пост","Отчёты","Article","Блог"],"title":"Artificial intelligence","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ganina Taisia"],"categories":["My week"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;Как дела?\u0026#39;) On Monday, I wake up hard after the weekend, but I know that new tasks and things are waiting for me.

Currently, there are many scientific programming languages, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages.\nOne of the most popular programming languages in the scientific field is Python. It is used to work with data, create machine learning models, analyze statistical information, and much more. Python is easy to learn and has a simple syntax, which simplifies the creation of programs and allows you to concentrate on the task.\nAnother popular programming language for the scientific field is R. R is used to perform statistical data analysis, create graphs and diagrams, analyze biological and economic data, and much more. It is also very popular in the field of machine learning, as it has many libraries and tools for data analysis.\nMatlab is a very commonly used programming language in scientific and engineering fields for computational mathematics, data analysis, creation of graphs and diagrams, algorithm development and much more. The most important advantage of Matlab is its powerful toolkit, which allows you to work with large amounts of data and solve complex problems in any field of science and engineering.\nAnother programming language for the scientific field that has become very popular recently is Julia. It is a relatively new programming language that is designed for programming scientific computing, high-performance computing and parallel computing. Julia has speed and high performance, which allows you to perform complex tasks an order of magnitude faster than using other programming languages.\nIn addition, there are other programming languages specialized for specific scientific fields, such as MATLAB in engineering, Scilab in data analysis, Fortran and C++ in high-performance computing, Perl and PHP in bioinformatics, etc.\nIn conclusion, we can understand that choosing the best programming language for scientific applications depends on the specific task, the required performance and the tools needed to do the job. Each programming language has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to choose and use them correctly in accordance with the task.\n","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"cb514bfcc7e97980857a61f64cb6d30a","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","section":"post","summary":"What are scientific programming languages and what are they eaten with?

This project took me three months, in total, about two hundred hours were spent writing code, selecting photos, searching for links and downloading the necessary textbooks.\nMy website is aimed at high school students. On the main page you can find 6 links. One of them leads again to the main page, the other to a page where it is told about the school, and also a link to the school’s website is attached. 4 more links-buttons are needed to help high school students in the study of natural sciences. If you click on any of the so-called “subject” links, you will go to a page entirely dedicated to a particular science. On this page, you can download textbooks for grades 10-11, find resources for preparing for the Unified State Exam, as well as school curriculum materials that will help even those children who do not pass the State Exam in these subjects. Among the materials you can find articles, as well as video tutorials, from short ones that are needed to repeat the topic as a whole, to long ones that are useful for those who missed the topic.\nWhat is the advantage of my site? I think in ease of use. Each page has a minimum of intuitive buttons, each of which is responsible for a specific function of the site. At the bottom of any page, you can find three buttons that are linked to the school’s social media accounts.\nThe site files themselves are uploaded to the server and can be attached to other pages on the Internet. Since the server is free, there is no domain, it means that it is impossible to find the site through a search engine, but there is open access via a link that will open on any device.\nThe main language in which the site is developed is HTML, the design is developed thanks to CSS, and pop-ups on pages with objects are already jQuery.

It can be designed in various formats and applied in various fields, such as accounting, project management, medicine, scientific research, etc. The main purpose of the report is to convey information and feedback.\n##Why do I need a report?\nThe report is needed to document and analyze information about activities or processes. It allows you to evaluate performance, determine success and problems in work, and make decisions based on the data obtained. Reports play an important role in organization, business, research, project management, etc. Depending on the goals and objectives, reports may have a different format and structure, but they are all aimed at providing information for decision-making.\n##Report content\nThe title page with the number of the laboratory work and the full name of the student. Formulation of the purpose of the work. Description of the results of the task: – screenshots (screenshots) that record the performance of laboratory work; – listings (source code) of programs (if any); – program execution results (text or screenshot depending on the task).

Everyone will survive! A little history and theory Markdown is a text markup language that was developed by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004. Markdown was designed as an alternative to more complex markup languages such as HTML. It is based on the idea of using simple symbols to indicate text formatting, such as the “*” sign to italicize text. Gruber and Schwartz developed Markdown using simple syntactic rules that can be quickly mastered by the user. This greatly simplifies the process of writing text with formatting.\nSince its inception, Markdown has become a popular tool for creating web pages, documentation, personal blogs, and more. Now it is one of the top tools for writing text content on the Internet. Markdown can be used in various areas where quick and readable creation of documentation, blogs, forums, etc. is required. Most platforms, including GitHub, Reddit and Stack Overflow, support Markdown language as an alternative text input and markup.\nMarkdown is a markup language that is used to create formatted text using simple characters. Markdown can be used in code editors, blogs, social networks, emails, etc.\nBelow are examples of practical use of Markdown:\nCode examples Creating a structured document: headers, lists, tables ``\nFirst level header Second level header Third level header # First level header ## Second level header ### Third level header `` * List * The second element * The third element `` * List * The second element * The third element `` | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | | --------- | --------- | --------- | | Content 1 | Content 2 | Content 3 | | Content 4 | Content 5 | Content 6 | Text selection: bold text, italics, strikethrough text `Bold text’ = Bold text\n*Italics* = Italics\n~~Strikethrough text~~ = Strikethrough text\nCreating links to external resources [Link name](link address)\nGoogle\nInserting images ![Image name](Image address)\nInserting the code Use apostrophes (`) to insert inline code\nvar anyVariable = 5;\nUse three apostrophes (```) before and after the code block\nfunction myFunction() { return \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;; } ","date":1680652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680652800,"objectID":"bd238f54b82fdcd586f8f7e438599565","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2023-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"What is Markdown and what is it eaten with?

Carefully and in vain, because it didn’t help me, but this is already a spoiler, I’m taking away the “bread” from Tuesday.\n🤔 Tuesday: The matanalysis test was sudden and ruthless, after which the mood beat the bottom of all the marks “lousy”. Then gymnastics in physical education added a degree of intensity, so I came home and sat down to write a story to calm my nerves. The shortest and fastest story is participation in the “Songfic” challenge from Fanficus. It was based on a musical composition without the words “Despair” - Eddie van der Meer. As a result, the story “House” turned out, which got into the challenge only half, because it was necessary to write 2000 characters, and I went beyond 4000, sad, very sad (no). I had to publish it in my profile, which I don’t regret at all. Then I also made a cover using artificial intelligence, it turned out very beautiful (I attach the cover, everyone should see this beauty).\nThe work is called “Home”. Follow the link, read!\n😊 Wednesday: The most beautiful day, just two couples and a great romantic evening: me and the sixth lab. The laboratory responded to me in return. She didn’t even have to be persuaded for a long time, I think she was waiting for this date herself. So take note: if the laboratory does not respond to your requests, try to promise her a beautiful report. I was pleased with the fact that the grades for the test came - everything turned out to be not as bad as I thought. So I cheered up and took up the report with renewed vigor.\n😎 Thursday: A long, but not very difficult day with the realization of the wonderful fact that I already passed the code on Programming Technology last week, and I don’t need to do it again. It’s a beautiful day. A beautiful tree stump. I am beautiful and my song!\n🙄 Friday: The good thing is that you can get enough sleep. It is disheartening that couples are up to 19:20. I am glad that I managed to have lunch. It’s depressing that I had dinner late. The result was a 50/50 day. As the probability of meeting an elephant on Nevsky Prospekt. Either you will, or you won’t.\n💫 Saturday: I slept well, that’s a plus. I sat down to finish everything that I didn’t do earlier - this is a minus. I’ve been thinking for a long time why I didn’t do it earlier. I remembered that I was writing a story. I was pleased with the new comment and sat down to finish the project.\n💭 Sunday: A hazy future.\n","date":1679097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679097600,"objectID":"92aa703898f586172a512d058417563d","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F-1/","publishdate":"2023-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F-1/","section":"post","summary":"All the latest events from their direct participant.

When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nIn classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can save not the full version of the modified files, but perform so-called delta compression — save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored.\nVersion control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.\nVersion control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch. In addition, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted.\nUnlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\nExamples of using git 💬 The Git version control system is a set of command-line programs. They can be accessed from the terminal by entering the git command with various options. 💌 Due to the fact that Git is a distributed version control system, a backup copy of the local storage can be made by simple copying or archiving. For example, below is a description of the main commands of the git system.\nDescription of the main commands of the git system Command Action git init Creating the main repository tree git pull Getting updates (changes) of the current tree from the central repository git push Sending all changes made to the local tree to the central repository git status View the list of modified files in the current directory git diff View current changes git add . / git add \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; / git rm \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; Saving current changes git commit / git commit -am \u0026#34;commit description\u0026#34; Saving added changes git checkout -b_name Creating a new branch based on the current one git checkout branch name Switching to some branch git push origin_name Sending changes of a specific branch to the central repository git merge --no-ff_name Merging a branch with the current tree git branch -d branch_name Deleting a local branch already merged with the main tree git branch -D branch_name Forced deletion of a local branch git push origin :branch name Deleting a branch from the central repository Did you find this page helpful?

Она изгибается хищными поворотами, как образцовая змея, манит недосягаемой линией горизонта - и прячется. Скрывается в облаках, ненадолго спустившихся с неба и отчего-то решивших, что вот здесь, на пути машины, им самое место. Конечно, это не сами облака. Это лишь туман, делающий вид, что он похож на его небесных братьев. Он оплетает кольцами машину, стучится в стекло - ради любопытства, вдруг кто-то откроет окно и пустит его во внутрь?\nТуману интересны люди, сидящие в машине. Теплые и живые, недосягаемые для него - холодного и бесплотного. Он мог бы им многое рассказать, в обмен лишь на каплю тепла. Взяв за свои истории лишь толику жизни. Один глоток. О, сколько бы он отдал за этот глоток! У него нет несметных сокровищ, чтобы одарить людей. Все, чем он может их обогатить - знания и время. Он может дать им мгновения, которые окажутся ценнее вечности. Миг, определяющий вечность. Минуту на размышления, спокойствие и отдых, в которых так часто нуждаются путешественники, сами не знающие, чего они ищут. “Увы! он счастия не ищет // И не от счастия бежит”, как писал М. Ю. Лермонтов. Как паруса блуждают люди в тумане, сами не зная, чего они хотят, и слушая его истории. Он бы рассказал такое, от чего волосы встают дыбом, или такое, от чего захватывает дух. Он мог бы описать все войны, мог бы рассказать про все подвиги. Мог бы поднять до императорских дворцов или опустить до лачуги рыбака. Лязг мечей и вой труб, песни победителей и плачь побежденных, лай собак, смех детей, звуки молитвы… Если бы у тумана была голова, она бы уже лопнула от всех этих образов. Поэтому, в какой-то мере он рад, что человеком не является. Вечный и вездесущий, он был свидетелем рождения мира и появления Христа, он видел великую храбрость и подлую трусость… Он опутывает все дороги, от самых широких магистралей, до старых римских дорог, проложенных еще в первом веке.\nНаверное, он видел и то, что произошло в маленькой деревушке в рассказе Людмилы Улицкой “Путь осла”. Возможно, он даже помог брату Марку найти ягненка, а после дойти до дома Женевьев. Может быть, он даже собрал этих людей вместе? Не даром автор рассказа использует прием цветописи, “показывая” нам оранжевые и золотистые оттенки, будто делясь с нами теплом через эти образы. В тот вечер в доме было настолько тепло от доброты, что туман-то уж точно не упустил возможность и забрал кусочек себе. Маленький осколок добра, пробившийся тусклым блеском золотых букв на обложках книг, которые лежали на стуле Иветт, звуками музыки и пением Эйлин. И в благодарность за этот осколок туман рассказал им про Рождество. Рассказал осенью, а не снежным зимним вечером, не вслух, а образами, настолько яркими, чтобы они навсегда отпечатались в памяти людей, волей случая собравшихся в том доме. Да и как еще мог рассказать о чуде он, не имеющий голоса?\nЭто путешествие по-настоящему обогатило всех присутствующих в той комнате вечером. Новыми знакомствами, чувством единения, настоящим чудом, ведь чудеса, оказывается иногда случаются, если между абсолютно незнакомыми людьми вдруг возникла “сильнейшая связь”, природу которой рассказчица затруднилась объяснить. Чудеса приходят с первым словом ребенка, который, казалось, не заговорит никогда. С пением псалмов, настолько проникновенных, что “святые должны были бы быть беспросветно глухими, если бы не поспешили” туда. С падающей звездой, необычайно большой и яркой.\nИ я понимаю, что была свидетелем чего-то похожего. Не так, не там и не такого, но чего-то очень близкого. Я видела звезды в Якутии. Они были такие же, “преувеличенные”, размером со спелые яблоки. Мы остановились в низине, и вот странная штука - там звезды были намного ярче. чем на возвышенности. Видимо, чем ниже мы находимся, тем ярче сияют нам звезды, согревая своим холодным ровным светом. Чем меньше мы ждем, тем больше нам воздается. Так героиня рассказа “Путь осла” не ждала ничего особенного от своего визита в маленькую деревню, но нашла там не только людей, с которыми приятно общаться, но и настоящее чудо, которого, вполне возможно, ей так не хватало в жизни. В вечной спешке мы забываем оглянуться по сторонам, не видим и не замечаем самого главного, с головой окунаясь в бешеный ритм жизни. Хорошо, если будет затишье, момент абсолютного спокойствия, путеводное чудо, способное наставить нас на путь переосмысления, абсолютный ноль, с которого после начнется отсчет другой жизни. А какой она будет - зависит только от нас.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a8edef490afe42206247b6ac05657af0","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BE-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B5/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BE-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B5/","section":"event","summary":"Дорога вьется живой лентой, уводя в туман.
